# Visualizations
The JavaScript Visualisations for various problems in Computer Science and Mathematics

## Why?
To understand a problem you need to understand properly what it wants from you. I always find visualisatiing the probelms always help me do it better.
So, I decided to implement all the intresting problems I come across in some kind of a graphical way.
Please help me by adding topics and improving my code!

## How?
I use the p5.js Library for all the graphical purposes.

## What Next

- [ ] Tower of Hanoi Problem
- [ ] Fourier Serie
- [ ] DFT and FFT
